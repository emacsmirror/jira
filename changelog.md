## 2.10.1 (2025-10-11)
- Better Error Handling On `jira-issues--fetch-and-display`.
It fixes the following problem reported by @Gchouchou:

```
I am having issues recovering from errors running jira-issues--fetch-and-display.
If, say you run with an invalid jql, jira-issues--loading-p would be set to t
because the callback will never be evaluated to set it back to nil. I tried to see
if this is a simple fix but it requires some refactoring of jira-api-search to
customize error handling and make sure we set jira-issues--loading-p back to nil
after an error. The manual fix is not too hard (just set it to t) but it would
be greatly helpful to people that do not want to go into the source code and
wonder issues stopped reloading.
```
